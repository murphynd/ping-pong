#### By _**Natalie Murphy**_

## Description

_A user enters a number and the application returns all numbers from 1 to the user input with the following changes:
All numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by "ping".
All numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by "pong"
All numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced by "ping-pong"._

take in a number that is a string change to a int 
create a list of numbers from that inputed number counting down to 0 
make a loop to identify numbers in list that are divisable by 3 ,5 ,3 && 5 
switch list items from the number that exists to a string "ping", "pong" "Ping-Pong"
